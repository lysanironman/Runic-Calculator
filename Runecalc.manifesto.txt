						Runic Calculator

The Rune Calc Manifesto is a file that explains briefly the history of the Runic Calculator Idea and what inspired
its creation. A Magus by the name of Scrilon once came upon a system so powerful that it needed to be hidden not 
only behind the blinds of Hebrew, but also those of the Runic Script. More specifically, the potent and vibratory 
system of the Elder Futhark. The Elder Futhark consists of 24 Glyphs that are arranged in a specific order. This 
order is believed to have arisen due to the innate pattern of manifestation that begins between Glyphs 12 and 13
(Jera and Eihwaz). A sort of Right Cross is formed between these Runes. Jera represents the horizontal while 
eihwaz represents the vertical. In Union, they rotate around their central axis. Due to their shape, they begin to
resemble that of a Grand Solar Wheel, riding high above the skys, reflected on the Moon's face. And thus, if Runes
may be spied for their sunny outer qualities, so too can they be used for their internalized mathematical qualities.
It is for this reason that the magus wills this calculator into being. For those who break this code, the true heart 
of the magus is to bring that which is within, without.
